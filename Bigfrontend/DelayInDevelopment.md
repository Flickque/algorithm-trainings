# What would you do if your progress is dragged own by other teams?

[#103. Behaviour, Bigfrontend](https://bigfrontend.dev/question/What-would-you-do-if-your-progress-is-dragged-own-by-other-teams)

A common problem in a big company.

Interviewers want to see you take ownership, when delay happens, don't just wait but try yourself to push the project forward even it is not your responsibility.

Try to keep everyone informed of each other's progress, find the risk as early as possbile.

Prepare for this with a solid real case to show your unique value, use a case that could interest the interviewer to ask more about it.

When speaking, follow this template: situation → obstacles → actions → result

## Solution

Situation:
I was working as a frontend developer alongside a backend developer colleague on a new financial web application. My task was to implement the interface based on a provided design. Given the simplicity and small size of the web interface, I was able to complete my tasks ahead of schedule.

Obstacles:
However, my backend colleague still had significant work to do on the API, and there was a potential risk of a delay in the overall project timeline.

Actions:
Instead of simply waiting, I took the initiative to move the project forward. Recognizing the importance of tech debt, I began writing technical documentation for the project and invested time in creating comprehensive unit tests. This not only improved the overall quality and maintainability of our application but also ensured we maximized our productivity. Throughout this period, I kept the team informed of my progress and frequently checked in with my backend colleague to ensure a smooth integration process when the time came.

Result:
By the time my colleague completed the API, I was well-prepared to integrate the frontend and backend. The proactive measures I took not only prevented any delays in the project but also enhanced the overall robustness of our application through added documentation and test coverage.
